# Inky-Java
Java implementation of [Zurb's Inky template](https://github.com/zurb/inky) processor


Initial checkin to support a subset of tags in case others find it useful or want to turn it in to a proper project. 

Currently only tested against two small email templates, but will continue adding as needed.

```
String processed = Inky.releaseTheKraken(html)
```

Implemented: button row columns container callout center spacer wrapper

Not implemented: inky block-grid menu menuItem
